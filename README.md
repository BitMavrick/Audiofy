# Description
<table >
    <tr>
       <td style="width: 50%;">
           Audiofy2 is a media player app that lets you enjoy your favorite tracks and playlists with a simple and intuitive interface. You can switch between light and dark themes, search for tracks, albums, artists and playlists, add songs to your favorites, create, edit, delete and play your own playlists, and more.

Audiofy2 is built using Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UIs. It uses Kotlin as the programming language, coroutines and flow for asynchronous and concurrent programming, Jetpack DataStore for data storage, Android Architecture Components for robust, testable, and maintainable design.

Audiofy2 is a beta version of the app and is still under development. Some features may not work as expected or may be unavailable. Please report any bugs or using the issue tracker. Thank you for trying Audiofy2. üòä

## üß∞ Build and run the project
If you are a developer and want to build and run the Toolz app from the source code, you need to follow these additional steps:

### Prerequisites
- Install Android Studio Alpha (Hedgehog) or above on your machine. You can download it from here: https://developer.android.com/studio/preview
- Install Git on your machine. You can download it from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

### Steps
To build the Audiofy app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: Open a terminal window and type the following command: `git clone https://github.com/iZakirSheikh/audiofy2.git`
2. Add the private file:

Some features and functionalities of the app require a private file that contains some keys and ids. To add this file to the project, do the following:

- Create a file named `Private.kt` in the package `com.prime.media.core.billing`.
- Paste the following code into the file:

```kotlin
package com.prime.media.core.billing

object Private {
    /**
     * Base64-encoded RSA public key to include in your app binary
     */
    const val PLAY_CONSOLE_PUBLIC_KEY = "replace_this_with_id"
    const val UNITY_APP_ID = "replace_this_with_id"
}

object Product {
    const val DISABLE_ADS = "replace_this_with_id"
}

object Placement {
    const val INTERSTITIAL = "replace_this_with_id"
    const val BANNER_SETTINGS = "replace_this_with_id"
    const val BANNER_UNIT_CONVERTER = "replace_this_with_id"
}
```
Note: Replace the placeholders `replace_this_with_id` with the appropriate values for your app. You can get these values from the Play Console, Unity Dashboard, or other sources.

3. Open Android Studio and select Open an existing project.
4. Navigate to the folder where you cloned or downloaded this repository and select it.
5. Wait for Android Studio to sync the project and resolve the dependencies.
6. Run the app on an emulator or a connected device by clicking the Run button.

You have successfully built and run the Audiofy app from the source code. Enjoy!
